        "## How do we do Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "* The discounted cash flow method is used by professional investors and analysts at investment banks to determine how much to pay for a business, whether it is shares of stock or the whole company. \n",
        "\n",
        "* It's also used by financial analysts and project managers in major companies to determine whether a given project will be a good investment. \n",
        "\n",
        "* At it's most fundamental level, it's applicable to any scenario where you are considering paying money now in expectation of receiving more money in the future.\n",
        "\n",
        "* This model rests on the principle that an investment now is worth an amount equal to the sum of all future cash flows like a Markov Decision Process"
