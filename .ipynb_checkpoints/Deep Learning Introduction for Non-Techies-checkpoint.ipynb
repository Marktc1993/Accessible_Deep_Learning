    "Great! Now we should define the general architecture of our network... Feel free to refer to this documentation religiously (https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/). What is a neural network? Broadly speaking a neural network is going to be comprised of an input layer and then subsequent layers that perform transformations on the data before finally reaching the output layer, which in this case is predicting the onset of diabetes given certain conditions. In simple terms we can think of each layer as a new logistic regression function, as I have written in psuedo code: z = dot_product((weights.transpose),(inputs)) + bias \n",
    "\n",
    "This should look familiar to any practitioners of linear regression, if not here are some helpful refreshers https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/precalc-matrices/multiplying-matrices-by-matrices/v/multiplying-a-matrix-by-a-matrix, http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/uADA/12/lectures/ch12.pdf  \n",
    "With this equation we then calculate the activation function sigmoid = 1/(1+e^(-z)) if z is large we get a number very close to 1, and if z is very small (negative) we a number very close to zero, thus a binary classifier (0 or 1). Concretely, I like to define neural networks as stacks of logistic regression layers. This isn't technically correct, but is a good starting point before exploring the other components.\n",
    "Some more housekeeping, I have spoken to several practicing Data Scientists and most of them use Keras as the front-end and have Tensorflow do the heavy lifting in the back (tensorflow has been found to be much faster than it's competitor Theano in most applications). This is noteworthy because it saves lines of code and Keras has a lot of utility because it automates many of the tasks of Tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Digression aside, our goal is to have our cost function be minimized, and in the case of Logistic regression we want to minimize our \"binary cross entropy\" cost function. We can think of this process in terms of taking steps towards the bottom of a hill, each epoch (iteration through the entire data set) will show us the loss which can be seen as a single record value for the cost function."

Luckily, there are ways to rectify that, including a regularization term which helps the model be more cool and behave less like a obsessive significant other.
