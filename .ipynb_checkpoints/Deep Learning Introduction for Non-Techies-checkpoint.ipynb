    "Great! Now we want to the general architecture of our network... Feel free to refer to this documentation religiously (https://keras.io/getting-started/sequential-model-guide/). Let's define what a neural network is, broadly speaking a neural network is going to be comprised of an input layer and then subsequent layers that perform transformations on the data before the output layer, which in this case is predicting the onset of Diabetes given certain conditions. In simple terms we can think of each layer as a logistic regression equation as I have written in psuedo code: z = dot_product((weights transpose)o(inputs)) + bias \n",

    "With this equation we then calculate the activation function sigmoid = 1/(1+e^(-z)) if z is large we get a number very close to 1, and if z is very small (negative) we a number very close to zero, thus a binary classifier (0 or 1). Concretely, I like to define neural networks as stacks of logistic regression layers. This isn't technically correct, but is a good starting point before exploring the other components.\n",
    "Some more housekeeping, I have spoken to several practicing Data Scientists and the common practice is to use Keras as the front-end and let your backend be Tensorflow (tensorflow has been found to be much faster than it's competitor Theano in most applications). Keras has a lot of utility because it automates many of the lower level tasks of Tensorflow.\n",

We can think of this process in terms of taking steps towards the bottom of a hill, each epoch (iteration through the entire data set) will show us the loss which can be seen as an index value of the cost function and we want to see the loss decrease.
